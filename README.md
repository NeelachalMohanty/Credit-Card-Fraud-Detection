# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project presents a deep learning approach for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using fully connected neural networks. It leverages a **pipeline that integrates SMOTE + Tomek Links** to automatically address class imbalance during model training.

Multiple neural network configurations were tested by varying **activation functions** (`ReLU`, `Tanh`) and **optimizers** (`SGD`, `Adam`, `RMSprop`). The **best-performing model was selected** based on metrics such as **F1-score**, **ROC-AUC**, and **Confusion Matrix** performance.
